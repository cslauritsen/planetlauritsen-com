[Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.ynharari.com) is an important voice in
modern discourse. As a historian, he brings a perspective that relates
how patterns of human behavior in the past are relevant to the present.
His latest opus, _Nexus_,
is an insightful and sometimes frightening look at what the near future
could hold.

## Prophet, said I
Two things I appreciate about his writing. One, he cautions us against magical thinking, for instance,
that the arc of history tends toward justice.
Two, he eschews the idea that "history repeats itself" as the old adage says. 
As a historian, Harari 
does not wish to take up the mantle of a prophet, rather that of a guide to help us think
out the possibilities that could arise from the information networks we are currently building, 
especially with regard to AI. 

The title, _Nexus_, references his main thesis, that the ability 
of [Sapiens](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/) to achieve dominance
on the planet is tied to our language ability--that one mind can create reality
in another mind by means of communication. Through
language we form information networks that bind large groups of people to a set of
shared goals. Leaders are those who gain control over the information in the network.
Through the mind-to-mind "nexus" people are able to forge new shared fictions that people
agree to regard as real. This builds upon a key thesis of one of his previous 
works, _Sapiens_, referenced above.

The trouble is the goals are evil as often as they are good, and he spends great deal
of time outlining how over the course of human history that people have used information
networks to create what he calls "intersubjective realities"--ideas that do not 
have grounding in empirical truth, but nevertheless are real inasmuch as they affect the actions
of fellow humans.

I very much enjoyed how he takes us through the history of information networks,
using the Sumerian invention of cuneiform as an early example. The mere ability to store information
leads to an information retrieval problem as the network of tablets grows. 
A bureaucracies forms, and it assumes a great deal of control over people's everyday lives. 
The ability or inability for individuals to store and retrieve relevant documents can
mean the difference between freedom and prison, even life or death. 

## Malleus Maleficarum
{{<floatimg side="right" src="./malleus.jpg" width="250" alt="An Artifact with Cuneiform writing on it" >}}
A more sinister example was how the printing press was used in its early days to
form a bad misinformation network. 
Printed works such as the _Malleus Maleficarum_, i.e. "The Hammer of Witches" and other derivative and related
titles, motivated generations of Europeans to believe in witches. Neighbors would
defame marginalized people. They must be to blame for all manner of problems like plagues,
bad harvests, and the untimely deaths of loved ones. As such, these must be punished and
eliminated if the problems are to stop.
While today we may click our tongues at such foolishness of our ancestors. We now as a society 
think the notion of prosecuting individuals or whole families for the crime of "witchcraft" is risible. In that
time it loomed large in the shared "intersubjective" reality, at an immense cost of human suffering.


## Alien Intelligence
As someone who makes use of AI on a daily basis, I find it to be a real accelerator to productivity. 
It's like having Encyclopedia Brown in your pocket, able to answer questions that I can casually compose
on any subject, quickly. Not only that, but it is capable of understanding context of my 
question without me having to make it explicit. This saves
tremendous effort and time trying to figure out what relevant details to provide to frame the question.

Chat GPT, Microsoft Copilot, Claude, these all provide relevant answers very quickly. 
Using these tools is much more efficient than paging through Stack Overflow posts--no carping by persnickety 
gatekeepers, no spam, no ads, no unending list of links to visit to see
if they might pertain to what I need to know.

Harari makes a point to refer to AI, not as "artificial intelligence" but as "alien intelligence".
Most of the second half of the book focuses on this notion, that the intelligence we are creating
is not so much artificial, but more importantly, it is _alien_ to us. Computers 
process information in a means that is impossible for humans. They are able to consume vast amounts of it, 
quickly, and to never forget or miss a detail. This is in stark contrast to human intelligence,
which relies on intuition and emotions rather than vast quantities of data to make decisions.

There are several chilling descriptions of how this technology is already being put to use in ways
that could eliminate the notion of privacy, and through that, the notion of individual freedom. In 
particular, he notes how the Iranian government uses computer vision to monitor women who might be 
violating the country's dress code, even automating enforcement.

Here in the US, as our own government onboards the use of AI for more and more tasks, it is chilling to
imagine what could lie ahead of us. I wonder if it is even possible to avoid some very dystopian outcomes.
